# AWN

AWN is a simple, unfinished, web newsreader optimized for mobile terminals with tight screens. Code is experimental at the moment. Code requires only php5 at the moment.
Due security reasons, main script doen't connect the remote news server but reads the data from a local spool populated by newsagent.php that must be executed by cron on regular basis.
